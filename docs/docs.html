			<h1 id="started" class="page-header">Getting started</h1>
			<p class="lead">Ascott Inventory Management (AIM) tool provides an easy setup for IT managers and programmers.
				Read through to see what suits your particular needs.</p>
			<h2 id="started-init">Hardware initialisation</h2>
			<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
		    <p>If this application is intended to be run on a cloud service (e.g. Amazon Web Services, Heroku, DigitalOcean), the following steps apply likewise. Feel free to replace the MySQL host address with one from your preferred provider if so.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Before the application can be initialised, ensure the following Python packages are installed on your server:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Python 2.7+</b> (only Python 2 is supported for now)</li>
				<li>Flask</li>
				<li>Flask-Babel</li>
				<li>Flask-MySQL</li>
				<li>Flask-WTF</li>
				<li>Flask-uploads</li>
				<li>NumPY, SciPY, statmodels, Pandas</li>
				<li>pytz</li>
				<li>Pillow</li>
				<li>mysqlclient</li>
				<li>mysql-python</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To install all required Python packages at once, navigate to the project root directory and enter the following in a terminal:</p>
			<div class="highlight">
				<pre>$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>
			</div>
			<p>For WSGI and database functionality, Gunicorn and MySQL respectively must be installed as follows:</p>
			<div class="highlight"><pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gunicorn
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
</code></pre>
			</div>
			<p>During installation, the software might prompt for a root username and password. Feel free to use your username and password of choice. <b>Remember this</b> because we will use this information to connect to the database, if we choose to run everything locally.</p>
			<h2 id="started-dev">Run locally (development mode)</h2>
			<p>You can enable hot-compiling by running in development mode with these options in <code>/instance/config.py</code> turned on:</p>
			<div class="highlight">
				<pre><code>DEBUG = True
MYSQL_DATABASE_USER = 'root'                      # replace this with your own username (must be in quotes)
MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD = "your_chosen_password"  # replace this with your own password (must be in quotes)
MYSQL_DATABASE_DB = 'Ascott_InvMgmt'              # DO NOT MODIFY
MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST = 'localhost'
</code></pre>
			</div>
			<p>Before we can launch the application, connect to the newly-setup database running locally (or elsewhere) and run all SQL scripts in the <code>db</code> folder. This will setup all the necessary tables and views for the application. Once this is completed, navigate to the root directory in the application folder and run the following command to start it in <b>debugging mode</b>:</p>
			<div class="highlight">
				<pre>$ python application.py</pre>
			</div>
			<h2 id="started-prod">Run locally (production mode)</h2>
			<p>You can run in production mode with the following config:</p>
			<div class="highlight">
				<pre><code>DEBUG = False
MYSQL_DATABASE_USER = 'your_username'             # replace this with your own username (must be in quotes)
MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD = "your_chosen_password"  # replace this with your own password (must be in quotes)
MYSQL_DATABASE_DB = 'Ascott_InvMgmt'              # DO NOT MODIFY
MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST = 'localhost'
</code></pre>
			</div>
			<p>Before we can launch the application, connect to the newly-setup database running locally (or elsewhere) and run all SQL scripts in the <code>db</code> folder. This will setup all the necessary tables and views for the application. Once this is completed, navigate to the root directory in the application folder and run the following command to start it in <b>production mode</b>:</p>
			<div class="highlight">
				<pre>$ sudo nohup gunicorn --workers 8 --bind 0.0.0.0:80 wsgi:application &</pre>
			</div>
			<h2 id="started-cloud">Run on the cloud</h2>
			<div class="highlight">
				<pre><code>DEBUG = False
MYSQL_DATABASE_USER = 'your_username'             # replace this with your own username (must be in quotes)
MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD = "your_chosen_password"  # replace this with your own password (must be in quotes)
MYSQL_DATABASE_DB = 'Ascott_InvMgmt'              # DO NOT MODIFY
MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST = 'akfji82.coxb3venarbl.ap-southeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com'     # EXAMPLE: remote address
</code></pre>
			</div>
			<p>Run the following command via ssh to start it in <b>production mode</b>:</p>
			<div class="highlight">
				<pre>$ sudo nohup gunicorn --workers 8 --bind 0.0.0.0:80 wsgi:application &</pre>
			</div>
			<h2 id="started-stop">Stopping the application</h2>
			<p>If running in development mode, simply break by pressing <code>CTRL+C</code>. If running in production mode, first run this command:
			<div class="highlight">
				<pre><code>$ ps ax | grep nohup\ gunicorn</code></pre>
			</div>
			<p>The process ID of the running job will be displayed on the first output line as a three-to-five digit number. <b>Note this number down.</b> Then run this command to stop the application:</p>
			<div class="highlight">
				<pre><code>$ sudo kill -15 [PROCESS_ID]</code></pre>
			</div>
			<h2 id="started-dir">Directory structure</h2>
			<p>A list of important directories of the project is as follows:</p>
			<div class="highlight"><pre><code>/

		<!-- Features -->
		<div class="bs-docs-section">
			<h1 id="features" class="page-header">Features</h1>
			<p>Ascott Inventory Managment is an extensible inventory management platform designed to collect, parse and transform inventory transactions into structured data for easy querying and indexing. It serves a website allowing users to efficiently view information from selected stock items in an intuitive and visual manner.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- Architecture -->
		<div class="bs-docs-section">
			<h1 id="architecture" class="page-header">Architecture</h1>
			<p class="lead">Ascott Inventory Management is built on <em><a href="flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a></em>, which provides MVC functionality for hassle-free extensibility.</p>
			<h2 id="architecture-overview">Overview</h2>
			<a href="assets/arch.png" target=_blank>
				<img src="assets/arch.png" alt="Click for full size" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
			</a><br>
			<p>The application can be said to comprise three discrete parts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/"><em>Flask</em> framework</a></li>
				<li>Reorder point prediction algorithm</li>
				<li>MYSQL databases</li>
				<li>Client browser</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Seen in the diagram above, data always flows from the database to the client. The application therefore serves to retrieve, extract, and deliver that data from the database to the client.</p>
			<p>The Application itself can be segregated into "back-end" and "front-end". A general rule by which this
				classification is made is that components that put data into the database are considered "back-end",
				while components that retrieve data from the database are considered "front-end".</p>
			<p>The back-end's main responsibility is to extract, parse and store data from user input and run an algorithm to predict reorder point fast as 
			    reasonably possible every night, so that the data can be delivered to the user as quickly as possible
				upon request.</p>
			<p>The front-end's main responsibility is to handle HTTP requests, and deliver content from the log file to the user
				in the form of HTML or JSON, which can be served to the user's web browser via HTTP. It is only responsible for handling
				user requests, so it is only active when a user request is submitted. Most of the data that is served by the
				front-end can be simply retrieved from the database, but, as mentioned above, some have to be retrieved directly
				from the file system due to the voluminous nature of the data. The front-end also retrieves information
				directly from the file system if the nature of the information is not predetermined.</p>
			<p>Once it possesses the information that was requested by the user, it puts this information into a dynamic
				HTML template, and serves it to the Client. The front-end also deals in JSON, which is used to dynamically populate a
				HTML page that has already been delivered.</p>
			<p>The above framework implementation and infrastructure is also known as a MVC (model-view-controller) architecture.</p>
			<h2 id="architecture-packages">Packages</h2>
			<p>All sources are contained in the root directory.</p>
			<p>From the <a href="#architecture-overview">architectural overview</a>, it is clear that there are four important types of
				entities in the application (which correspond to the four most prominent packages):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Algorithm functions</li>
				<li>Database retreival objects</li>
				<li>Controllers</li>
				<li>Templates</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Parsers</b> are objects that extract data from log files, by reading them line-by-line and performing
				certain processing operations on each line of text.</p>
			<p><b>Database retreival objects</b> are objects that act as the interface between the application and the database files.
				Instead of allowing all parts of the program to make direct connections to the databases, all methods
				that involve some sort of interaction with the database are encapsulated in the DAO Objects. This
				design decision was made to ensure thread safety, among other things.</p>
			<p><b>Controllers</b> are objects that handle HTTP requests, and pull together the necessary resources
				to serve the correct content back to the requester.</p>
			<p><b>Templates</b> are objects that contain HTML intertwined with Scala code providing dynamic content. HTML pages are
				delivered by these objects when they are called in controller methods.</p>
			<p>Other packages, such as <code>charts</code>, <code>cart</code> are less important, but they are critical in
				displaying and visualising parsed data. These packages form the "front-end" of the application.</p>
			<h2 id="architecture-poe">Points of entry</h2>
			<p>There are three possible situations where the system is actively performing tasks:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When the Application is started up</li>
				<li>When an HTTP request is received</li>
				<li>When the prediction algorithm runs every night at 12mn</li>
			</ul>
